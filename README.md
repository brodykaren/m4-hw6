Second repo for my Pizza assignment. After I emailed my Professor. I started fresh.
During my first repo, I had so many problems because I was confusing Java and Jvascript. 
I worked with a tutor because I needed more practice with somebody that knows Javascript because I was very frsutared and I coudnt get it right. 
I'm practicing with codeacademy and watching again the class videos as well.
finally after a couple of day I figurate out how to add every charged to the final pizza cost.
