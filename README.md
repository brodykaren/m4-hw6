Second repo for my assignment
During my first repo, I had so many problems because I was confusing Java and Jvascript. 
I worked with a tutor so I can have more practice with somebody that knows Javascript because I was very frsutared and I coudnt get it right. 
I'm working with codeacademy also, and I can understand more now.
