Second repo for my Pizza assignment. After I emailed my Professor. I started fresh. 
During my first repo, I had so many problems because I was confusing Java and Javascript. 
I worked with a tutor. I'm practicing with Codecademy and watching again the class videos as well. 
finally, after a couple of weeks, and many attempts, I  pass all the tests! all green!
Thank you so much for the extra days!
